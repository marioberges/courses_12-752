## Project Submission Instructions

Please upload your project reports (a PDF file, an IPython Notebook file, and any datasets or extra files you may need) by creating a folder with your AndrewID (if you are teaming up with someone else, any one of the Andrew IDs is fine), and then placing the file in that folder.

After you do this, the next step is to add, commit and push the changes, by doing something as follows (imagine this is for my AndrewID, and I'm assuming I'm in the root folder of the repository):

	git add projects/mberges/*
	git commit -m "Added my project report"
	git push origin master
